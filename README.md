# HR-analytics-python
HR analytics project using Python for employee data analysis
HR Analytics Python Project üìä
Project Overview üìù
This HR Analytics Python Project involves analyzing employee data to derive insights related to salaries, experience, departments, and other HR metrics. The dataset includes key information such as salary, experience, department, and location, and the goal is to clean, preprocess, and build predictive models to forecast salaries based on various factors.
The project incorporates data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning techniques to make the data actionable and meaningful for business analysis. Using Python and various libraries, we explore the dataset, build models, and provide meaningful insights.

Files Included üìÅ:
HR_Analytics_Project.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook with all Python code for data analysis, model building, and visualizations.
dataset.csv: The dataset used for the analysis (sourced from Kaggle/Google Drive).

Libraries & Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è:
This project utilizes a variety of libraries to achieve the goals of data analysis and machine learning model development. Below is a comprehensive list of the libraries used in this project:

Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: A core library for numerical operations and array handling.
Matplotlib: For generating visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and histograms.
Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that simplifies creating complex plots like heatmaps and pairplots.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for building predictive models. We used various modules such as:
train_test_split: For splitting the data into training and testing sets.
LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor: For building regression models.
StandardScaler: For scaling numerical features to improve model performance.
feature_selection.SelectKBest: For feature selection and reducing model complexity.
ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: For random forest model building and performance evaluation.
SciPy: For scientific and statistical calculations (including correlation analysis).
Statsmodels: For performing statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.

Key Concepts & Techniques üí°:
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing üßπ:
Null Value Handling: The dataset had missing values, which were identified and replaced using mean or mode imputation depending on the column type.
Data Transformation: Categorical features were converted into numerical values using encoding techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Feature Scaling: Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure the machine learning models performed efficiently.
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to ensure proper model validation.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç:
The first step in the analysis was to understand the distribution of variables and the relationships between them.
Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn helped uncover patterns in the data, such as the distribution of salaries across different departments and the correlation between experience and salary.
A heatmap was created to visualize the correlation matrix and identify which features had strong correlations with the target variable (salary).

3. Machine Learning Models ü§ñ:
Linear Regression: A foundational regression model was built to predict salary based on the features in the dataset.
Random Forest Regression: Used for non-linear relationships between features. A RandomForestRegressor model was trained and tested, yielding better performance compared to linear regression.
Feature Selection: Applied SelectKBest from sklearn.feature_selection to identify the most important features contributing to the model's prediction.
Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess their accuracy.

4. Data Visualization üìä:
Matplotlib was used to create bar charts, histograms, and line plots to visualize the distribution of data and relationships between features.
Seaborn helped generate more advanced plots, such as box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps for visualizing feature correlations and the spread of data.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap was created to show the correlation between different variables in the dataset. This helped identify which variables are highly correlated and which features may be redundant.

5. Challenges Faced üõë:
Handling Missing Values: During the preprocessing phase, handling missing values was a challenge, especially with categorical data. I used imputation techniques for numerical columns and mode imputation for categorical columns.
Model Tuning: Selecting the right model and tuning its parameters took time. The RandomForestRegressor outperformed the linear regression model, and I experimented with different configurations of hyperparameters to find the best model.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features was initially challenging. Using SelectKBest helped reduce model complexity and improved prediction accuracy.
